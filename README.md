Quackery is a chat app created through Express, Node, MongoDB, JS, and Socket.io. You first pick a username (anything) and it gets saved into unique session data.
Once you select a username, a connection socket will be made between the server and web browser. Since this is created with Socket.io, multiple users can connect and see
the most updated messages.
