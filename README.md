# Quackery

Quackery is a chat app created through Express, Node, MongoDB, JS, and Socket.io. You first pick a username (anything) and it gets saved into unique session data.
Once you select a username, a connection socket will be made between the server and web browser. Since this is created with Socket.io, multiple users can connect and see
the most updated messages. One of the biggest problems I faced was being able to update everything real time with the proper session data.
